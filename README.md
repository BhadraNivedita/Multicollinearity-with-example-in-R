# Multicollinearity


Multicollinearity refers to a situation in statistical modelling where two or more predictor variables in a multiple regression model are highly correlated, meaning that one can be linearly predicted from the others with a substantial degree of accuracy. This correlation among predictors can cause problems in estimating the coefficients of the regression model because it inflates the standard errors, making it difficult to determine the individual effect of each predictor on the dependent variable.

### Indications of multicollinearity 

1. High standard errors for regression coefficients
2. Overall model is significant but none of the predictors
3. Large changes in coefficients as soon as a new predictor is added to the model
4. Coefficients have opposite signs that of expected from the theory
5. High VIF(variance inflation factor) and low tolerance
6. Cofficents of a subset of the sample are widely different
7. High condition indices
