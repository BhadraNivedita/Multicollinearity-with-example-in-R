# Multicollinearity


Multicollinearity refers to a situation in statistical modeling where two or more predictor variables in a multiple regression model are highly correlated, meaning that one can be linearly predicted from the others with a substantial degree of accuracy. This correlation among predictors can cause problems in estimating the coefficients of the regression model because it inflates the standard errors, making it difficult to determine the individual effect of each predictor on the dependent variable.
